#scrapToFeast" Leftover Food Waste Management System



ScrapTOFeast is more than just a website; it's a platform that connects individuals and event organizers with nearby NGOs, facilitating the donation of surplus food from events like weddings, birthday parties, and more. 🎉

 this groundbreaking website, revolutionizing food donation. Not only event organizers but anyone with an event at home can contribute by simply registering on ScrapTOFeast. When filling out their location details, the website displays the nearest NGOs on the screen, making the donation process as easy as a few clicks. 🌐

But that's not all - ScrapTOFeast also benefits NGOs by providing them with real-time information about nearby events where they can collect surplus food, thus reducing food waste and increasing the shelf life of donated items. 📈

ScrapTOFeast isn't just about reducing food waste; it's about fostering a community-driven approach to addressing hunger and supporting those in need. 🤝 By extending its reach to NGOs that cater to stray dogs, ScrapTOFeast ensures that even our four-legged pals receive the nourishment they deserve. 🐶

"Scraptofeast" is a community-driven project dedicated to tackling leftover food waste. Through partnerships with local businesses, charities, and municipalities, we raise awareness, redistribute surplus food to those in need, and implement innovative solutions like technology integration and community engagement. Our goal is to create a sustainable model for food waste management while fostering a sense of responsibility and community ownership. Join us in turning scraps into feasts for all.
